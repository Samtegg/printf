In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. 
You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). 
We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

Don’t forget to push your header file
All header files included in the main.h are guarded from the double inclusion issue
